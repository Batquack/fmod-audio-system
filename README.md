# FMOD Audio System

This is a sample project to show a simple integration of FMOD and Unity.

The *audio-system-fmod-project* directory is the FMOD project.

The *audio-system-unity-project* is the Unity project.

# Audio File Info

Audio files used in this FMOD project are all from FMOD's example project with an exception for the 'Coin Collected' and 'Coin Idle' sounds which I made myself. 

The Audio files in this project should be only be used for non-commercial or educational purposes.
